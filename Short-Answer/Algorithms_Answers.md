#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear time complexity because the number of operations will increase n times as the data set increases.


b) O(n^2) because the number of operations will increase n^2 times as the data set increases


c) Constant time because the number of operations is constant irrespective of the data size.

## Exercise II

<!-- create a function that takes the number of story buildin -->
<!-- device a means to get eggs that were dropped and not broken -->
<!-- get the maximum height they the eggs that were not broken where dropped from (loop) -->
<!-- that height is f -->
<!-- the time complexity of my algorithm would be O(logn) because I'm using divide and conquer approach -->
